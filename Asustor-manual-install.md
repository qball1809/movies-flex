The Web Tools utility for the Asustor models of NAS aren't in the App Central app list.  You will need to download the file from the download located here:  https://github.com/ukdtom/WTInstaller/blob/master/bin/asustor/Asustor-Inst-WebTools_1.0.0_any.apk

Then you have to open the App Central application in the Asustor Device Manager (ADM) and manually install the application from the Manual Install choice on the left side.

This presents a browse line where you then browse to where you saved the file to.  Next step is to upload.  After the file is uploaded to your NAS, it gives you a security warning about non-official applications.  Just hit OK on this.  The app installs and you see it show up in the ADM main page as well as in the App Central list of installed applications.  

Accessing WebTools from there is either d-clicking the icon in the ADM, or browsing to a bookmarked site.  If you use your Asustor NAS with a DDNS you will need to make sure you set up a port forwarding rule to access the tools from outside your network.
